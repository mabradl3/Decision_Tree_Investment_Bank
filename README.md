# Decision_Tree_Investment_Bank
Creation of a decision tree for an investment bank.

The assignment is as follows:
You work on the analytics team at a large investment bank. While many
of the departments are analytically savvy, a portion of the sales team is just
beginning to come out of the realm of telemarketing and into the digital age.
They’ve collected data on some 45,000+ previous customers and would like
to use that data to gather some guidance on how to know what product to
suggest to current customers next. They are interested in sending out promotional information on 4 different ’products’: Brokerage Accounts, Roth IRAs, Term Deposits (CDs), and Mortgage Refinance Offers. They would
like some analytical guidance in order to determine which promotions to
send to which individuals, but they are not ready to implement a fancy
real-time model with software. They’re looking for simple rules to guide
them in their marketing assignments.
